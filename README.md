# 💼 Project Lead Contribution Summary – Sheriann McLarty

As the project lead, I contributed the following to ensure the successful execution of this team project:

- ✅ **Cleaned and formatted five core datasets**:  
  `clean_ds_applicants.csv`, `clean_ds_salaries_2025.csv`, `clean_sods_survey_2023.csv`, `clean_nyc_jobs_utf8.csv`, and `clean_job_spy_jobs.csv`.

- 🛠️ **Designed and deployed the relational MySQL database**, including table creation and schema design based on our ER diagram.

- 📥 **Developed Python import scripts** to automate and validate data ingestion into the database.

- 💾 **Created and shared a reproducible SQL schema and backup**, allowing team members to rebuild the database locally.

- 📂 **Centralized all cleaned data, raw data, scripts, and documentation** into a shared Google Drive and GitHub repository for transparency and reproducibility.

- 🧭 **Led the team’s workflow**, managed version control, fielded troubleshooting questions, and provided SQL/R guidance when issues arose.

- 💬 **Advised team members** on how to use the ER diagram for querying instead of cleaning datasets again.

Due to time constraints and delays in participation, I focused on delivering a complete backend infrastructure and database framework, ensuring all team members had clean, consistent data to work from. 

My submission reflects my end-to-end contributions to data wrangling, architecture, and project management.
